# My React App

This is a React application created with Vite, a fast and modern build tool for web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this app locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or later) 
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/0xcirxle/Chainlink.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd frontend`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build: `npm run build`

This will create a `dist` folder with the compiled assets, which you can then deploy to a static hosting service.

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to various static hosting services such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Here are the steps for deploying to Netlify:

1. Create a new site on Netlify and link it to your repository.
2. Configure the build settings to use the `npm run build` or `yarn build` command.
3. Deploy the site, and Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy the site whenever you push changes to the repository.
